The original dataset - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27563488 and http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2043872 consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patch’s file name is of the format: u_xX_yY_classC.png — > example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.
